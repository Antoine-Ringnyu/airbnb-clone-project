# airbnb-clone-project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on **backend systems, database design, API development, application security, and CI/CD pipelines**.  

This project enables learners to gain practical experience in building scalable systems while collaborating effectively in a team environment.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals  
- Master collaborative workflows using GitHub.  
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design.  
- Implement advanced API security measures.  
- Gain proficiency in CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.  
- Strengthen skills in project documentation and planning.  
- Learn to integrate technologies like **Django, MySQL, and GraphQL**.  

---

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack  
- **Django** â€“ A high-level Python framework for backend and RESTful/GraphQL API development.  
- **MySQL** â€“ A relational database for managing structured data such as users, bookings, and payments.  
- **GraphQL** â€“ Query language for efficient and flexible data retrieval.  
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization tool for creating consistent development and production environments.  
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI/CD platform for automating testing and deployment pipelines.  

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Roles  
- **Backend Developer** â€“ Builds backend logic, APIs, and integrations with external services.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA)** â€“ Designs and optimizes the relational database schema, manages queries, and ensures data integrity.  
- **DevOps Engineer** â€“ Manages CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and deployment processes.  
- **Frontend Developer** â€“ (Optional) Creates user interfaces to consume the backend APIs.  
- **QA Engineer** â€“ Tests features, ensures functionality, and maintains quality standards.  
- **Project Manager** â€“ Oversees tasks, timelines, and coordinates team collaboration.

## ðŸ—„ Database Design  

**Entities & Example Fields:**  
- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`  
- **Properties**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id`  
- **Bookings**: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`  
- **Reviews**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
- **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  

**Relationships:**  
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to both a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Review** is linked to both a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is associated with a **Booking**.  

---

## âœ¨ Feature Breakdown  
- **User Management** â€“ Secure registration, login, and profile management.  
- **Property Management** â€“ Hosts can list, edit, and remove their properties.  
- **Booking System** â€“ Users can browse, book, and cancel reservations.  
- **Review System** â€“ Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
- **Payment Handling** â€“ Secure processing of booking payments.  
- **Search & Filters** â€“ Find properties by location, price, and amenities.  

---

## ðŸ”’ API Security  
Key measures include:  
- **Authentication** â€“ Secure login with JWT or OAuth.  
- **Authorization** â€“ Role-based access control for guests, hosts, and admins.  
- **Rate Limiting** â€“ Protects against excessive requests or abuse.  
- **Data Validation & Sanitization** â€“ Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- **Encryption** â€“ Ensures sensitive data like passwords and payments are secure.  

**Why security matters:**  
- Protects user privacy and financial data.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to the system.  
- Builds trust between users and the platform.  

---

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline  
- **What is CI/CD?**  
  Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that new code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main branch. Continuous Deployment (CD) automates delivery of tested code into production.  

- **Why it matters?**  
  - Faster, more reliable releases.  
  - Reduces human errors in deployment.  
  - Improves development team efficiency.  

- **Tools Used:**  
  - **GitHub Actions** â€“ Automates testing and deployment workflows.  
  - **Docker** â€“ Ensures consistent environments across development and production.  
  - **(Optional) Kubernetes** â€“ Orchestration for large-scale deployments.
